# Visualizing Text2Shape
Visualization tool for [Text2Shape dataset](http://text2shape.stanford.edu/).

## Overview
This repository provides some visualization tools for [Text2Shape dataset](http://text2shape.stanford.edu/). This dataset has been introduced in 2018 and provides paired data samples of 3D shapes and text descriptions.

## Download
The text descriptions and the 3D models can be downloaded at [this link](http://text2shape.stanford.edu/) and they consist in:
* csv file with id, model_id, text_description
* folder with 3D data, for each model_id

## Visualization Ideas from ChatGPT
* **3D Scatter plots**: Create a 3D scatter plot of the shapes, with each point representing a shape. You can use color or size to indicate different features of the text, such as the sentiment or the genre.
* **Word clouds for shape and text**: Create word clouds for both the text description and the shape, and compare the two to see how they relate to each other.
* **Shape similarity plots**: Use a clustering algorithm to group similar shapes together and then create a scatter plot or heat map to visualize the clusters. You can use color or size to indicate different features of the text, such as the sentiment or the genre.
* **Interactive 3D shape visualization**: Use an interactive 3D visualization tool, such as three.js, to allow users to explore the shapes and the text descriptions.
* **Text network**: Another way to visualize the content of text is to create a network of the words, with edges connecting words that appear together in the same sentence or paragraph. This can reveal patterns in the text, such as the relationships between different topics or the way ideas are related to one another.
